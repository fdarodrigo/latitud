Latitud is an innovative application born out of a personal need, providing a completely new approach to finding available rental properties. Unlike traditional methods where you start by typing in neighborhoods or regions, Latitud flips this trajectory, allowing you to explore properties on an interactive map.

You can draw a polygon by clicking to outline a specific area on the map and search for properties within that defined region. Much better than searching by neighborhood, you can search by regions that encompass multiple neighborhoods or areas.

Additionally, within the delimited region, you can search for nearby places (gyms, schools, hospitals, restaurants, and universities) and general city information about traffic, subway, and bike lanes.
